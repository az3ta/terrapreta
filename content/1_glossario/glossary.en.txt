  term: Clearing2
  definition: >
    Area of the forest where trees thin out
    or are lost. This forms a turf in which
    various ecosystems, called heliophilic
    environments, can proliferate due to
    direct solar radiation. The philosopher
    Heidegger uses the metaphor of the
    clearing to describe the sudden
    brightness in which a wayfarer wandering
    in the midst of a dense forest can find
    himself, comparable to the enlightenment
    of reason.

  term: Ecosystem Services
  definition: "Set of benefits, in economic-financial terms, that a healthy biological system - such as a forest or even a lone tree - is able to provide to a given land or urban context. They fall into four macro-categories: life support (nutrient cycling, soil formation and habitat healthiness); provisioning (food, potable water, energy, raw materials, medicinal or genetic resources); regulation (of climate, tides and flooding, water purification or hydrogeological balance); cultural values (aesthetic, spiritual, educational and recreational). ESâ€™s are not yet adequately quantified, in comparable terms with economic services and manufacturing capital, although the world's economies would suffer a major setback without their life support."

  term: Fabaceae
  definition: >
    A very numerous family of plants, also
    known as leguminosae. They are very
    hardy plants, with rapid growth cycles.
    Through a bacterium, Rhizobium
    leguminosarum, they are able to fix
    atmospheric nitrogen, making their
    presence essential for the
    sustainability of agro-ecosystems. This
    large family includes Mimosa, Robinia,
    Vicia, Broom, Wisteria, Alfalfa and
    Clover.

  term: Foreste Urbane
  definition: >
    Powerful NbS that support human life and
    natural ecosystems within the urbanized
    context. They provide multiple
    environmental, social, and economic
    benefits, including carbon sequestration
    and storage, reduction of heat island
    effects, and flood containment. They
    improve human health, both physical and
    mental, as long as limiting energy
    consumption and providing shelter for
    wildlife by offering food and shade.

  term: Mother Tree
  definition: >
    The elder trees of a forest, around
    which the underground networks of roots
    and mycorrhizae are organized. These
    monumental trees, being taller and
    storing more sunlight, send their carbon
    to younger trees to help them develop,
    including those of other species,
    preserving biodiversity.

  term: Mycorrhiza
  definition: >
    Special type of symbiotic connection
    occurring underground between fungi and
    tree roots. Through these symbioses, two
    or more organisms can exchange nutrients
    or ally in defense against environmental
    stress and diseases. Some fossil remains
    testify to the existence of
    endomycorrhizae on earth as early as 450
    million years ago, at the same time as
    the first forms of plant life appeared.
    Mycorrhizae are believed to have been
    instrumental in the process of creating
    the temperate ecosystems in which human
    beings later developed. The best known
    mycorrhizal symbioses, for culinary
    reasons, are those between truffles and
    oaks or porcini and chestnut trees.

  term: Nature-based Solutions (NBS)
  definition: >
    Strategic solutions based on proper
    planning of ecosystems in urban or
    suburban areas. They can help improve
    the living conditions of an area,
    mitigate costs spent on public health,
    aggregate the community, or plan a
    wide-range territory. Designing NbS
    necessarily begins with a study of the
    area in which they want to be applied,
    aimed to highlight distinctive features,
    strengths and weaknesses, opportunities
    and risks on which to focus design
    attention.

  term: Terra preta
  definition: >
    Particular type of soil of anthropogenic
    origin. Typical of the Amazon basin,
    terra preta (that means black soil from
    the Portuguese) has a very dark color,
    due to fertilization that took place in
    the pre-Columbian period, with organic
    material and vegetable carbon. From some
    scientific studies it appears that these
    lands have self-healing abilities,
    growing at the rate of 1 cm per year for
    millennia.

  term: Top Soil
  definition: >
    Surface layer of the soil, on average
    the first 20-30 cm. It is therefore a
    very important factor in terms of
    remediation of polluted areas, as it is
    the main route of exposure by dermal
    contact, ingestion or inhalation. In
    German legislation it is the benchmark
    for risk analysis aimed at making an
    area usable once again.
